**Backbone** is an **addon development framework** for [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com). To simplify the development process, it provides an easy-to-use toolkit for common tasksâ€”**event handling, localization, settings management**, and more.

_The framework is currently in the **alpha** stage. It's not recommended for use in addons that are intended for public release as it may be subject to changes prior to reaching a stable release._
